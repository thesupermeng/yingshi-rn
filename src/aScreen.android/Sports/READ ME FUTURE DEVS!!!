This folder contains all the source code for the Sports 体育 tab.

The source code is referenced from "MIGUA". Another app developed by another team.

As such, all the assets, dependencies are stored in this folder - separate from the main app.

The Sports app is meant to be independent from the rest of the app and can be removed/added to the main app with minimal changes.

The only dependencies from the main app are that the React Navigator from the main app references the Screens from the Sports app.

The original source code is written in javascript while our main app is in typescript.
